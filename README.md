sudoku solver
=============
**author:** will leinweber (will@bitfission.com)

A simple sudoku solver using the observer pattern. It probably can't solve hard ones where you have to take guesses and check, but I'm not really sure since I never actually play sudoku.

To use, run `ruby solver.rb` and enter the numbers from left to right, 0 or blank for empty cells.
